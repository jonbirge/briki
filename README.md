# brikipaedia

## Overview
Under development. Just a stupid project to take a list of words and use the Wikipedia API to create an EPUB encyclopedia for offline use (such as on a Kindle).

## Why?
I decided to do this because (a) I have found myself in situations with poor internet connectivity while reading a book and wanted to look stuff up for background and (b) I currently find myself on travel with plenty of time, can't do work, but do have a laptop. This seemed better than binge watching Netflix.

## Name?
It's a contraction of Britannica and Wikipedia. The idea is I'd take the word list from Britannica (because Wikipedia has a LOT of stupid articles nobody needs) but pull the articles from Wikipedia.
